## Hello World!

With this `Hello World!`, I shall break any curse that may hunt me in the darkest night of the coldest winter.

One day my father, he told me:

```python
"""
Son, don't let it slip away...
One day you'll leave this world behind
So live a life you will remember.
"""
```
<br>

It wasn't actually my father who told me that, this is the lyrics for the song `The Nights` by `Avicci`. But I thought that was a nicer start that saying that I like long walks at the beach.

First things first, let's keep it simple.

```python
def  life_until_now():
    trajectory = (
        "I once was a child;"
        "I once was a teenager;"
        "I once learned to learn, now I learn everyday;"
        "I once was a Business Intelligence Analyst, messing with BI tools;"
        "I once was a Tattoer (yes, really);"
        "Today I'm may be a Developer,"
        "tomorrow I'll have to debug something for sure."
    )
    print(trajectory)

life_until_now()
```

<br>

Thank you for reading!
