## Hello World!

With this `Hello World!`, I shall break any curse that may hunt me in the darkest night of the coldest winter.

First things first, let's keep it simple.

```python
"""
I once learned to learn, now I learn everyday;
I once was a Business Intelligence Analyst, messing with BI tools;
I once was a Tattoer (yes, really);
Today I may be a Developer,
tomorrow I'll have to debug something for sure.
"""
```

Thank you for reading!
